Azure Blob Storage
IAM roles: You can control who can do what with your files by assigning roles. For example, one person might only be able to view files, while another can edit or delete them.
Hot tier: Use this for files you need frequently, such as everyday documents.
Cool tier: Use this for files you don't need frequently, such as old backups.

GCP Cloud Storage
IAM roles: Similar to Azure, you can grant different permissions to specific people or apps. For example, one user might only be able to upload files, while another can delete them.
Encryption: All your files are encrypted by default, and you can bring your own encryption keys if you want. GCP also tracks who accesses or changes files, helping you monitor your data usage.
