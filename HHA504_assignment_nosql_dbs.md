I tried to connect to these two platforms, but I always meet the same error.. It says, 'No module named redis or pymongo.' I tried reinstalling them using 'pip install xyz' and switching to the virtual environment, but it still doesn't work.

###experience
Working with BigQuery was a smooth experience. Setting up involved creating a Google Cloud project, enabling BigQuery, and uploading the healthcare dataset. The interface was user-friendly, making the configuration and schema management easy. Running SQL queries was efficient, even on large datasets, showcasing the platformâ€™s scalability. I also found the built-in visualization tools helpful for quickly reviewing query results. Overall, the setup and usability made it an efficient platform to work with.
