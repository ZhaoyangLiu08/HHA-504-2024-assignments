###reflection
Pros:
You donâ€™t have to manage or maintain servers.
You only pay for the time your function runs, saving costs.
Limitations:
You may become too dependent on a specific cloud provider, which makes it more difficult to switch between providers.
Serverless functions are not always the best choice for long-running tasks or tasks that require constant connectivity.
