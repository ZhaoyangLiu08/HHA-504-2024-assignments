###reflections
User Interface: Both are user-friendly, but GCP offers more granular monitoring.
Cost Monitoring: GCP provides more detailed cost breakdowns, especially for BigQuery, which charges based on data processed.
Security: Both offer strong security, though GCP integrates IAM roles more smoothly for managing access.
