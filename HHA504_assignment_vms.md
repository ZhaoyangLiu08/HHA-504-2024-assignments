####Reflections
I need to say I like the GCP more. 
Although I must admire that I still know little about which machine series will be better and something else,  I think the GCP does a better job because there is only one page you need to complete when you want to create a VM. And it has better interaction when you select each options. The azure seems more professional and has more details. But the GCP is more friendly for a new guy.
