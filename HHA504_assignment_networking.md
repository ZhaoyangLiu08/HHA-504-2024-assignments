## 5. Conclusion
This assignment focused on creating virtual networks, assigning static IP addresses, and mapping IPs to domains in both Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Once the basic process was understood, the tasks in Azure were relatively straightforward and easy to complete. However, I encountered some issues in GCP when trying to configure a custom VPC network. After troubleshooting, I decided to proceed by using the default network in GCP, which allowed me to successfully complete the required configurations.
